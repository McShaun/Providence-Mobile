	  <strong>John 20:11-23<br /></strong>
	 Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb</span><span class="verse John_20_12"><strong>12</strong>&nbsp;and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.</span></p><p><span class="verse John_20_13"><strong>13</strong>&nbsp;They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?"<br>"They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."</span><span class="verse John_20_14"><strong>14</strong>&nbsp;At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="verse John_20_15"><strong>15</strong>&nbsp;He asked her, <span class="wordsofchrist">"Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?"</span><br>Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."</span></p><p><span class="verse John_20_16"><strong>16</strong>&nbsp;Jesus said to her, <span class="wordsofchrist">"Mary."</span><br>She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means "Teacher").</span></p><p><span class="verse John_20_17"><strong>17</strong>&nbsp;Jesus said, <span class="wordsofchrist">"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</span></span></p><p><span class="verse John_20_18"><strong>18</strong>&nbsp;Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.</span></p><p><span class="verse John_20_19"><strong>19</strong>&nbsp;On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, <span class="wordsofchrist">"Peace be with you!"</span></span><span class="verse John_20_20"><strong>20</strong>&nbsp;After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</span></p><p><span class="verse John_20_21"><strong>21</strong>&nbsp;Again Jesus said, <span class="wordsofchrist">"Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."</span></span><span class="verse John_20_22"><strong>22</strong>&nbsp;And with that he breathed on them and said, <span class="wordsofchrist">"Receive the Holy Spirit.</span></span><span class="verse John_20_23"><strong>23</strong>&nbsp;<span class="wordsofchrist">If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."</span>
