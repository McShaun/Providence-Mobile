      <h3>Live Centered On Your Spirit. Then All Things Will Go Well with Both Your Body and Spirit.</h3><br>
         <br>
      <strong>Scriptures: Matthew 19:27-29</strong><br>
      27 Peter answered him, &ldquo;We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?&rdquo;<br>
       28 Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Romans 8:5-11</strong><br>
      5 Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 6 The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. 7 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God&rsquo;s law, nor can it do so. 8 Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.<br>
       9 You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ. 10But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness. 11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>3 John 1:2</strong><br>
      2 Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.
