	<h2>Proverbs about Heaven</h2>
		<blockquote>"Heaven is made according to the desires of the Trinity. They want those who love them the most to come and live there.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Even you want to give the best things to those who live devote their body and love you the most among those who love you. You give to them and let them use it.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Things of the world are things given on a miniature scale as preparation to give eternal things in Heaven."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"Your location in Heaven is determined by your thoughts, actions, and accomplishments. Even in the same location, 
		your position is determined by how much merit you accumulated. However, even there, if you like water, he will let you live 
		with background of water, and if you like mountains, he will let you live with background of mountains. You definitely live
		 in a world that is a manifestation of your thoughts, actions, ways, and accomplishments."</blockquote>

	<h2> Proverbs about "flying"</h2>
		<blockquote>It's not that a big thing cannot fly because it's heavy or a small thing can fly because it's light. Regardless of size, it flies because it was created to fly.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Though big and heavy, earth flies in the Universe, but a stone, though small, cannot fly even on earth. Stars too fly in the Universe.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>The heart should fly in the midst of life.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>'To fly' means 'to free from restriction.'</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Just as creatures with wings live flying, human beings also should live flying in their respective field.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>There are people who fly by studying and making efforts on their own and there 
		are people who fly by living with the Almighty who created them and with the savior who saves them.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Human beings should fly in the body, fly with the mind, fly in the spirit, and 
		fly leading a life that enables their spirit to live forever. Only they will reach the greatest heights.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>If you live without being in love with the Lord who came to save the world, you cannot live your life flying.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Even within the same region, some live flying, some live walking, and some live crawling. It is not known until that life is lived.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>According to the deeds of your body, the life of your body on earth, as well the life of your spirit in the spiritual world, is formed.</blockquote>

		<h2> God's Will and the time period</h2>
		<blockquote> Those who do things out of their own volition are people who do things with a sincere heart. They know the highest Will. </blockquote>

		<p>- Friday, May 18, 2012</p>

		<blockquote> To those who have thorns lodged in their hands and heart, show them a person who
		 is nailed in his heart and head because of their sins and the sins of the time period. Teach 
		 them about the time period by teaching them what time this time period is and teaching them history. </blockquote>

		<h2>Proverbs about healing</h2>

		<blockquote>One person thought that a ghost was making him sick. All he did was pray for the ghosts
		 to be gone. When he was examined medically, [it turned out that] he was hurting because germs had 
		 invaded a wound. He was immediately healed when the wound was disinfected and medication was applied.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>There was a person who thought that they were in that much pain because one side of 
		his body was rotting. He went to the hospital and got x-rayed only to find that there was nothing
		 wrong. Demons and ghosts do not show up on x-rays. Ultimately they came out through prayer. </blockquote>

	<h2> Proverbs about mind and body</h2>
		<blockquote>A person's mind is "life" for the body. If you're going to communicate with the Lord, 
		your mentality must be connected to Him. To be "connected" means you must hook your heart to the 
		Lord's heart. Once you're linked, you will get through to Him through conversation.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>A person's body cannot take anything with them when they die. Likewise, you can't take
		 anything with you when you go to Heaven. Your spirits can take to Heaven only the righteous 
		 deeds and accomplishments you've done in the world. Such things are love, truth, and goodness. 
		 Once your spirit is transformed into a person of Heaven through love, truth, and goodness, 
		 you take your changed spirit with you to Heaven along with knowledge and wisdom about Heaven 
		 you've gained while the body was in the world.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>When constructing a large building the tools used by the workers are different, 
		the types of workers are different, and the work each worker does is different. All of them 
		must work together as one. Then the building will become complete. In the same way, those 
		who are working for the Lord must work together as one and be understanding of each other 
		even though their characters, personalities, and work are different. If they do, goals are 
		achieved and work gets done. If everyone does the exact same work, the building will not be 
		completed even in an entire lifetime. Everyone must help, care for, and love as they build 
		the building while thinking, "This is a house I will live in."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Your mind and actions have to be totally consumed with love for the Lord. Then you will not love anything in the world and you will not fall for those things.</blockquote>

		<h2> Proverbs about perception</h2>

		<blockquote>People who think that women are weaker than men will live their entire lifetime thinking women are weak and treating them as if they are weak.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Between men and women, which can be so cold to you that you feel frost fall in summer?</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Men and women are strong in their own ways but since women are naturally strong at love, their mentality of loving the Lord is strong too.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>If you perceive righteous people as sinners, they will seem like sinners to you.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Misunderstandings come from incorrect perceptions.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Even the Almighty can only work according to people's perceptions.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>People will never do something they perceive to be impossible, even if they are fully capable.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>In life there are many times people say things that upset you and create 
		conflicts with you. Don't store memories of such things in your brain, don't be aware
		 of them, only plug your ears, ignore them, and move on!</blockquote>

		<p> Proverbs about the body, soul, and spirit</p>

		<blockquote>When you are calling out to, praying, and petitioning to the Almighty 
		Holy Son of the Trinity, and focus on the Holy Son the Lord, you will gain realizations about His heart.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>The body cannot connect with the spirit by itself. Even your own body has
		 to go through the heart, mind, thoughts and soul in order to connect to the spirit. 
		 And even if it is your own spirit, it must do the physical work through the body.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>When you see your spirit in a dream, what you're seeing is a supernatural 
		effect in which your heart, mind, and soul appear and take action with the body's image
		 as the basis. That is not your spirit's actual image. That's an image of the spirit you
		 see through the heart, mind, and soul of your body.</blockquote>

		<h2>Proverbs about 'running until the end'</h2>

		<blockquote>A successful person keep running only on the path of success without giving 
		up on it, even if they have to give up on all other things so that they can continue to run on this path.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Whatever area it may be, when a person becomes an expert, they try it scores
		 of times (the first stage), they try it hundreds of times next (the second stage), they
		 try it thousands of times (the third stage), and then they try tens of thousands 
		 of times (the fourth stage). After these many attempts, when they are able 
		 to do it without a mistake, they become an expert.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Until 6, you have to wrestle with Satan. The side of Heaven is number 7. 
		Therefore, as long as they go to the end, they will win. The level which is one step 
		higher than number 6 is the number of love. If you love the Holy Son Lord 100%, you reach 
		number 7. The number of the one thousand year Complete Testament history, 7, which is the 
		last number, is the number of a thousand year wedding banquet of love. It is the number 
		of love. Therefore, whoever hopes to defeat Satan must raise themselves one level higher 
		than Satan's number and love only the Lord with number 7, that is the number of love.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Up to number 6, it is about faith, Word, praise, thanksgiving, prayer, 
		endurance, and obedience. Despite all that, Satan wrestles with us. If you add the last 1 
		to number 6, then it becomes number 7. And that [one number] is 'love.' Satan cannot love, 
		so he ends at number 6. When you just love the Holy Son Lord, the things of Satan end there. 
		Satan is opposite to love, so if we just love the Lord, it means the end for Satan.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>It is about earnest prayer and love.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Do not just have an earnest heart but take action with an earnest heart. Things work as you make up your mind and take action.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>The sound of truthfulness and sincerity sets one's heart on fire. Therefore, it does not stop there but actualizes what is in the heart in reality.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Having an earnest heart is like making something with complete devotion.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>The Holy Son Lord is sincere and truthful. Therefore, when human beings are sincere and truthful, they connect with the Lord.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>There is the ultimate difference between Satan and us--that is, Satan does not 
		love the Holy Son Lord. Therefore, it is easy for Satan to tempt us if we only try to be 
		saved by the Lord while not truly loving the Lord.</blockquote>

		<p>Proverbs about fulfilling hope</p>

		<blockquote>Whether you live in a palace, a grass-thatched house, confined in a prison, or 
		are going through any suffering or tribulation; you should not lose hope in the present and 
		live, doing every day what you must do and fulfilling the Lord's will in your current environment 
		and position. If you fail to receive what you should receive just because you are going through 
		sufferings in the present, you will not be able to receive it even if a peaceful time comes in the future.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>The hope of the future is fulfilled in the present.</blockquote>

	<h2>Past, Present, Future </h2>
		<blockquote>A life of hope that everyone dreamed would take place in the future is being lived everyday in the reality now.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Unless we fulfill the hope, dreams, and actions of the future in the reality now, they will not be fulfilled even in the future.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>If you cannot understand, view yesterday as the past, view today as the present, 
		and view tomorrow as the future. Unless you fulfill your hope for today, you will not be able 
		to fulfill the hope of tomorrow. In a human being's life, the past, the present, and the future

		<h2> Responsibility, Love </h2>
		<blockquote>People only pray for what they want but they are unaware that, in order to receive 
		what they want from prayer, they must set conditions and also equip themselves with action within 
		the Lord's Will. Hence, even though they petition, they fail to acquire it. Even if a person 
		prays earnestly and receives a positive answer from God, they must first do their human responsibilities
		in order to obtain. </blockquote>
		
		<p> - Saturday, March 12, 2011 </p>

		<blockquote> Even if a person loves the Lord, they must repent of their sins before the Lord can take them and make them his own.</blockquote>

		<p>- Saturday, March 12, 2011</p>

		<blockquote> A person whose purpose is love will think of that love in all situations and live for the sake of love.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Jesus' purpose is 'love.' He sets 'love' as his first hope, values 'love' as the 
		most precious life, and only talks about love whether in the beginning or in the end. The Lord 
		does all things for us with the purpose of 'love.' So if we love truly love him, when he sees us, 
		there is nothing that pleases him more than our love.</blockquote>

		<h2>Proverbs about the spirit</h2>
		<blockquote> The fate of one's spirit is determined according to the person's heart, thoughts,

		<p>- Saturday, February 26, 2011</p>

		<blockquote>The spirit is made and perfected according to the body's deeds, thus it comes to

		<blockquote> You don't gain things just because you try to gain more. You will make gains

		<blockquote>When you have the same actions, same heart, and same things repeating over 
		and over again, you will only receive things of that level and stage. You must change

		<blockquote>How long will you not change and continue to live in the mud brick home?

		<h2>Proverbs about God's history</h2>
		<blockquote> Understand that the 30 principles were words I received after virtually 
		trading my own life as I struggled mightily for those arduous 30 years. Correctly 
		knowing and understanding the words of God is not easy. I realized the words only 
		after laying such foundations and conditions. I ran for the Lord, reading the bible 
		2000 times, evangelizing 10,000 people per year, defeating all the satans and demons, 
		and overcoming all matters of physical adversities. So treacherous and wretched 
		was my physical life that I cringe even at the thought of it.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Now that the word of this time period has been proclaimed, it is spreading. 
		"Listen to the words of the Thirty Principles. The words of this time period have begun. 
		God's history has begun."</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Whether the person is suffering as a result of sins, laziness, or not receiving 
		blessings from God, we must help and have mercy on them regardless of the reason. When Jesus 
		came to this world with the mission from God to make salvation happen, he helped and comforted 
		the poor, the destitute, the prostitutes, sinners, and everyone else in need. We must do the 
		same in our lives so that we can enter the kingdom that God prepared and not be judged. Only 
		by living that way can we shine brightly. If you love me and obey my words, then you will help 
		those who love and follow me whenever they are in need, without pointing fingers and accusing 
		them of failing to fulfill personal responsibilities, of being ignorant, lazy, or having weak 
		faith. You must help them and watch over them as you would watch over your own bodies, and you 
		must eat and rejoice with them.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free. Jesus proclaimed 
		the words of salvation from God for that new time period, and when anyone who was a prisoner 
		of the former time period followed those words, then they became free. When the people came 
		to know the truth, then they were freed from the bondage of the OT [Old Testament]. And, in 
		the same way, those who were imprisoned by the spiritual domain of the NT [New Testament], by 
		hearing the words of this time period and the 30 principles, are now free. They now have 
		religious freedom, spiritual freedom, and physical freedom.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Make peace and resolve among you. Talk and maintain good relationships. If you 
		cannot resolve conflicts with visible men, how could you resolve conflicts with invisible God? 
		If you don't reconcile with one another, I myself do not resolve with you. In deep prayer, you 
		realize all your problems can be attributed to your shortcomings. You have learned the 30 
		Lessons and the tremendous Word of Heaven, so you have become quite polished in terms of 
		speaking. You have received all the necessary resources you need to be a man or woman of 
		Heaven. As a mouth to preach the Gospel of the time, your mouth should not be tough. 'Tough' 
		here means 'dirty,' or 'rotten'. </blockquote>
