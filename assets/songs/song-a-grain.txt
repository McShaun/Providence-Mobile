A Grain of Wheat

1. For the sake of this world's salvation<br>
If it takes someone to shed their precious blood<br>
For the sake of sinners' salvation<br>
If it must take a~ living sacrifice<br>
I will place my life on the altar<br>
Please use me, only for Your glory Lord<br>
<br>
<br>
(CHORUS)<br>
If I could give birth to just one more life<br>
If I could see Him just once<br>
Even if it's life or death, I will not hold back to give<br>
I must die to live again, I believe in the Lord's words<br>
I'll be a grain of wheat, in this barren land<br>
God please let me live, my life just like Jesus lived<br>
<br>
<br>
2. The Lord looks, for sheep who are weary<br>
All the spirits who are hurt and lost their way<br>
Instill in me, the heart of Je~sus<br>
The heart that aches for, even one more life~<br>
Guide me Lord, to take this path of the cross<br>
The path where He cri~ed for the world
