      <p>Verse 1<br />
My Lord who shines in the Word, He speaks with the Holy Spirit<br />
With justice My Lord rules, Oh, He is only love~<br />
My Lord has come, I'll celebrate. He came to judge with words of truth<br />
He came here, the earth in the sky. Will they ever know?
</p>
<p> 
Verse 2<br />
My Lord came with the Word of Truth, We praise Him with joy and gladness<br />
Shine your light of wisdom and knowledge, listen to the Word<br />
He has come right by our side, He came to save all of us<br />
Listen to the words of wisdom, realize, act on them
</p>
<p>
Verse 3<br />
My Lord came with the Word, He speaks with lips of fire<br />
He condemns all Satans, Oh, who could He be?<br />
My Lord came here on earth, He came to save this world<br />
If we meet the Lord in ignorance, we'll be at a loss<br />
</p>
<p>
Verse 4<br />
My Lord came in the midst of darkness and He brought light upon us all<br />
He brought to life our spirits once dead, Oh, who could He be?<br />
He revived those who were dead and saved His people<br />
He truly brought me to life, I shall give Him my all
</p>
<p> 
Verse 5<br />
My Lord called us all to fulfill the purpose of creation<br />
My Lord fulfills Heaven on Earth, there's only joy<br />
My Lord judges justly, He speaks words of truth and love<br />
My Lord gives us as much as we do, I shall follow Him
</p>
<p> 
Verse 6<br />
My Lord came like lightening, He proclaims the new truth<br />
My Lord raptures us into the sky, I shall follow Him<br />
He came to us from the East, flowers bloom in Korea (our Land)<br />
Let's build up a land of love, a land of truth
</p>
<p> 
Chorus<br /> 
Until I met the Lord face to face, it was only sorrow and pain<br />
My Lord came for me, for my sake, I know that now, He was with me all the while<br />
My Lord is by my side, My Lord who keeps me safe<br />
With the Lord who is my life, I~ shall live forever<br />
I shall live forever
